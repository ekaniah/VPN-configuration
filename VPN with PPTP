### Part 2 - Configuring VPN with PPTP

#### Time for Lab Completion:
1hr, 20mins

#### Purpose of the Lab:
The purpose of this lab is to teach one how to Test the Firewall.
Configure the VPN client.
Use Internal Services from an External Machine.
Tasks performed includes testing the current firewall and setting up the VPN server, configuring the VPN client,
capturing exchange between the server and the external machine using wireshark. mapping a drive to the server on the external machine
"Configuring VPN with PPTP" is crucial to cybersecurity because it regulates access to the resources on a network.
Without proper authentication, unauthorized connections to the network cannot be established. 
Also information transmitted using VPN is encrypted making it difficult for cyber criminal to intercept and access(read) it.

#### What did you enjoy about the lab?
I enjoyed learning how to use the 'net user remoteuser P@ssw0rd /add' in cmd prompt of the firewall to create a user.
And then using the 'lusrmgr.msc command to navigate to the user to set up the users access on the firewall.

#### What did you find most challenging about the lab?
I have been finding it difficult to capture data using wireshark. I really still don't understand how wireshark works.

Discussion Questions

Peer to Peer Tunneling Protocol
2.	What is a banner grab?
It is a test to check if outbound traffic is allowed on an external machine using the telnet command.
3.	What are ways that you can verify if outbound TCP/IP traffic is allowed?
4.	Using ping command , using telnet command, traceroute, netcat, tcpdump, wireshark, firewall log, network monitoring tools like solarwind, socket testing tools like socketlint and http/https testing tools like curl or wget to test connectivity.

Nmap

Discussion Questions
1.	Where do you go to connect to a VPN server in Windows 7?
